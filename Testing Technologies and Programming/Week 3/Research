What is Software Testing?

Software testing is checking that a program or application works properly before it is released.
It helps find bugs and problems so they can be fixed early.The main aim is to make sure the software does what 
it’s supposed to do and doesn’t break for users.

Functional Testing
Functional testing checks that the software works as expected.It focuses on what the system does and whether 
the features behave correctly.

Examples include:

Checking that a user can log in with the correct username and password.
Making sure a shopping cart adds up the total price correctly.
Testing that a form submits properly when all fields are filled in.

Non-Functional Testing
Non-functional testing checks how well the system works rather than what it does.It looks at things like 
performance, speed, security, and usability.

Examples include:

Testing how the system performs when lots of users are on it at the same time.
Checking that user data is secure.
Making sure the website works on different browsers and devices.
